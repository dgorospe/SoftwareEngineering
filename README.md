# Software Engineering Group Project - Website with database connectivity

The group consists of three students, each responsible for their own modules. My module was the Discussion Board webpages. Aside from working on my own module, I was responsible for creating the website, uploading the files to the server, creating the software documentation, and incorporating the other members input.

The website was created using HTML (used NotePad++), CSS, BootStrap, PHP, and MySQL (via phpMyAdmin).
